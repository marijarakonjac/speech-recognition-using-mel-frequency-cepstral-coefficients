# Speech Recognition Using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients: Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains the implementation of a **speech recognition system** developed as part of my **Bachelor's Thesis**. The system is designed to recognize spoken words using **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)** for feature extraction and the **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm for classification. The project focuses on analyzing the efficiency of cepstral analysis and the impact of word segmentation on classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

The system processes speech signals to extract features using **MFCC**, a widely used technique in speech recognition. These features are then classified using the **k-NN algorithm** to recognize spoken words from a limited vocabulary. The project explores the challenges of speech recognition, such as handling noise, dialects, and variations in speech patterns.

### Key Features:
- **MFCC-based feature extraction**: Analyzes speech signals to capture essential acoustic features.
- **k-NN classifier**: Classifies spoken words based on extracted features.
- **Word segmentation**: Investigates the impact of segmenting words on recognition accuracy.
